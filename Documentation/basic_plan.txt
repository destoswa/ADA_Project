Chapter 1 :	Reviews analysis
	- Ben - idea 2 : relationship between the number of reviews and the distribution in the rating.
	- Ben - idea 3 : relationship between the length of comment and general orientation of rating. implying sentiment analysis.
	- Xingchen - idea 2 : rating the reviewers based on the number/quality/type/... of their reviews.

Our proposition:

At first, we want to find out the distribution(s) of the ratings. Are there different distributions between ratings and different scales (10 ratings, 1000 ratings, etc) or breweries, beer-types, location, etc. For example, we can find out the rating distribution for different breweries and use these data to evaluate the popularity of these breweries.
In order to give reviewers a score to measure the reliability of their ratings and reviews, we would like to find the users whose rating distribution can best represent most of the information from a global scale distribution, for that we need to define a measure of “distance”, and we will assign higher reliability score to these users. This would also allow us to reduce the dataset and keep most of the information.
For the comments we can use sentiment analysis, TF-IDF methods to assign labels to different beers and breweries.



Chapter 2:	Events 
	- Mathieu - idea 1 : Find if there is regular paterns (spikes) in the reviews regarding different features: region, type of beer, brewery, ...
	- Mathieu - idea 3 : Looking if beer events have an influence on the reviews.
	- Swann - idea 1 : Looking if dramas regarding the breweries have an impact on the reviews.


Chapter 3:	Brewery expertise
	- Xingchen - idea 3 : Identifying Beer Specializations Across Breweries, coutries, timeline.
	
	
(Chapter 4: Corruption)
	- Ben - extra idea : The webiste "ratebeer.com" has been bought by AB InBev in 2019. We could collect a more ressent dataset and compare if this had an influence on the brands owned by AB.
