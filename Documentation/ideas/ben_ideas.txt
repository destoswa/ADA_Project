Overall, a good set of proposals. I’d recommend pursuing the second research question you present in idea #2. 

Idea 1: Original idea, but not very clearly presented. It is not clear how you plan to go from “beer types, 
breweries and beers that have received multiple reviews from the same individual” to analyzing the “bolster[ing] or 
tarnish[ing of] a brand's reputation.” How do you intend to measure “the perception of a brand, a brewery, or even a specific type of beer?” 
What metrics are you using? Will you employ an external dataset? I would also suggest you pick one (brand, brewery or beer type) and focus on 
that one for your analysis to start with, and later expand to consider the others if feasible. 

Idea 2: To me it looks like there are two different research questions in this idea. For the first one, interplay between number of reviews and 
overall ratings, is not bad but not necessarily easy to pursue with rigor. As you could read in one of the related papers, 
https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Lederrey-West_WWW-18.pdf , past reviews do have an impact on subsequent ones. 
How would you take this into account? With regards to the second question, does the number of beers produced by a brewery influence its overall rating, 
this is a more creative and original idea. I like it! You will want to flesh out the analysis a bit more than just ratings of their beers generally. 
Perhaps you can look at user segments, grouped based on geography – is the brewery catering to a specific audience, at least geographically? Etc. 

Idea 3: Not a bad idea, but I’m not sure how much analysis you can get out of it. Comparing review length and sentiment against the rating is a 
very simple analysis. If you want to pursue this idea, I’d recommend you develop it further and find other analyses you would like to run on this dataset.

1st Idea: The Power of an Individual or Group of Users. One compelling question that arises in the world of online reviews is whether a single user 
or a select group of users can significantly influence the perception of a brand, a brewery, or even a specific type of beer. 
Can one person's review either bolster or tarnish a brand's reputation? Are there dedicated fans or vehement haters who can sway the collective opinion? 
To investigate this, our study will examine beer types, breweries and beers that have received multiple reviews from the same individual. 
We must also consider the significance of brands with very few reviews, as they are inherently reliant on the limited ratings they accumulate. 
Uncovering the dynamics of the individual user's impact on the beer industry's reputation will be a key focus. 

2nd Idea: The Interplay of Review Quantity and Ratings. The second intriguing idea for analysis is exploring the correlation between 
the number of reviews and ratings and how these factors relate to the overall rating. In instances with only a handful of reviews or ratings, 
the average rating can be highly susceptible to extreme opinions, skewing the perception of the product. Conversely, for products with numerous reviews, 
we must investigate the distribution patterns that emerge. Does the sheer quantity of reviews create a more reliable or polarized rating system? 
Additionally, we aim to scrutinize whether the number of beers produced by a brewery influences their overall rating. 
Do breweries focusing on a limited selection of beers receive better ratings, possibly due to product quality, or worse ratings due to a mismatch 
with the general public's taste? 

3rd Idea: The Anatomy of Reviews and Their Impact on Ratings. The third idea delves into the structure and sentiment of reviews and their role 
in shaping product ratings. This analysis will examine the relationship between the length of a review and the accompanying rating. 
Are longer reviews indicative of extreme opinions, whether positive or negative, and do shorter reviews represent more moderate views? 
Additionally, by employing sentiment analysis tools, we aim to uncover a possible connection between the tone of a review and the associated rating. 
Can we quantify the positivity or negativity of reviews and examine how this sentiment influences overall ratings? Conversely, we'll evaluate 
the effectiveness of sentiment analysis tools on this dataset and assess whether the phrasing style of the reviews aligns with the tools' predictions. 
Ultimately, we seek to determine whether reviews serve as reliable indicators of product quality and whether sentiment analysis can enhance our 
understanding of user ratings.
