1. "Locked On Target! Helping Beer Novices Find Their Ideal Brew." While it might be uncommon for individuals over the age of 20 to be completely new to the world of beer, there is indeed a segment of people, including myself, who fit this description. To provide an entry point for these beer novices, we can utilize the dataset to create a beer selection guide. To tackle this challenge, we should initially consider the novice's location, which means we will categorize the beer data based on their origin. We can use the breweries' corresponding locations to indicate the beer's availability in specific regions. Second, the ratings and reviews from people in those regions can offer valuable insights into the quality, mouthfeel, and other beer characteristics. We can also employ word frequency analysis to assign labels to the beers, acting as a helpful guide for selection. Additionally, a world map with an interactive feature allowing users to click on specific areas to access beer information can intuitively present the results.
2. "Ensuring Trustworthiness! How to Determine Reliable Reviews." With a substantial number of reviews coming from nearly 16,000 users, it is crucial to sift through and select the trustworthy ones for presentation and subsequent analysis. The reliability of reviews is closely tied to the trustworthiness of users. We can calculate a weighted average credit rating for users based on factors like the number of reviews and the quality of their content. Using this rating, we can selectively showcase reviews and even identify the top ten beers preferred by these "beer experts." 
3. "Brewery Expertise! Identifying Beer Specializations Across Breweries." Given that different breweries often produce a wide array of beer styles, influenced by factors like regional characteristics and the brewery's traditions, it is evident that breweries have their own specialties and popular beer types. By analyzing user reviews and rankings, we can determine the beer styles in which specific breweries excel. We can also create a relationship network to visually depict the connections between various breweries and beer styles. 
4. “Beer Giant! Which countries are major consumers of beer?” Whether beer companies aiming to broaden their business horizons by exploring new markets or retailers seeking to optimize their inventory allocation according to demand, identifying regions with significant beer consumption is crucial for the advancement of the beer industry. To gauge beer consumption in specific countries, we can utilize a weighted average rating, factoring in elements such as the number of breweries, the user base, the total number of reviews, and the population size. This approach provides valuable insights into which countries stand as major consumers of beer.

Comments from TA:A good set of proposals. There were original elements and while the presentation was generally clear, several points were vague. I recommend you pursue idea #3. 
  Idea 1: I’m not quite sure I got what you’re proposing. Do you want to analyze the best beers per geographical location/country? What labels do you want to extract with word frequency analysis? What added value does the world map present? 
  Idea 2: An original idea! But evaluating quality is very much a non-trivial process. I leave a few examples: How can you ensure the number of reviews is good for trustworthiness and that the reviews are not being generated by a bot, for example? How will you measure the quality of reviews? Are you comparing the user’s rating against some gold labels (and if so, what are they)? Are they the average rating, wisdom-of-the-crowds style? Can you ensure those beers have gotten enough reviews for their average score to be trustworthy? What about beers whose score diverges between the two platforms? If you would like to pursue this idea further, you’ll need to first flesh it out more. 
  Idea 3: Interesting idea! Besides considering beer type and ratings/reviews, you should develop this idea further. You can look at the number of distinct beers produced by a brewery; at user segments, grouped based on geography – is the brewery catering to a specific audience, at least geographically? Etc. 
  Idea 4: I don’t understand why you are taking the production of beer into account in an analysis designed to analyze its consumption. A country could be a great exporter without consuming much internally, for example. Furthermore, is the data you have diverse enough, geographically, to conduct such an analysis? Finally, here are you getting the external data you mentioned, like population size? Your project mentor throughout the semester will be Beatriz Borges : beatriz.borges@epfl.ch. For future discussions specific to your P2 and P3 deliverables, you are encouraged to be in touch with your mentor.
